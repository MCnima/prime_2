About
This prime detector is made based on the Algorithm.txt file that I added in prime_2 repository.

Using Guide
For using code you have to inter your number after main.py in terminal or console with space between like:
main.py <your number>  => main.py 13 => The output is '<number> is prime!!!!'
or like: main.py 10 => The output is 'number is NOT prime by factor of <factor>'

*Notice*
This code is Not too efficient to calculate big numbers.
You can use is_prime function in Numpy package that is more efficient.

I hope this will be helpful for you.
